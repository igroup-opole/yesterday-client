# Contributing to yesterday

We would love for you to contribute to yesterday and help make it even better than it is
today! As a contributor, here are the guidelines we would like you to follow:

* [Issues and Bugs](#issue)
* [Feature Requests](#feature)
* [Submission Guidelines](#submit)
* [Development Setup](#development)
* [Coding Rules](#rules)
* [Commit Message Guidelines](#commit)

## <a name="issue"></a> Found a Bug?

If you find a bug in the source code, you can help us by
[submitting an issue](#submit-issue) to our [GitHub Repository][github]. Even better, you can
[submit a Pull Request](#submit-pr) with a fix.

## <a name="feature"></a> Missing a Feature?

You can _request_ a new feature by [submitting an issue](#submit-issue) to our GitHub
Repository. If you would like to _implement_ a new feature, please submit an issue with
a proposal for your work first, to be sure that we can use it.
Please consider what kind of change it is:

* For a **Major Feature**, first open an issue and outline your proposal so that it can be
  discussed. This will also allow us to better coordinate our efforts, prevent duplication of work,
  and help you to craft the change so that it is successfully accepted into the project. For your issue name, please prefix your proposal with `[discussion]`, for example "[discussion]: your feature idea".
* **Small Features** can be crafted and directly [submitted as a Pull Request](#submit-pr).

## <a name="submit"></a> Submission Guidelines

### <a name="submit-issue"></a> Submitting an Issue

Before you submit an issue, please search the issue tracker, maybe an issue for your problem already exists and the discussion might inform you of workarounds readily available.

### <a name="submit-pr"></a> Submitting a Pull Request (PR)

Before you submit your Pull Request (PR) consider the following guidelines:

1. Search [GitHub](https://github.com/igroup-opole/yesterday-client/pulls) for an open or closed PR
   that relates to your submission. You don't want to duplicate effort.
1. Fork the yesterday repository.
1. Make your changes in a new git branch:

   ```shell
   git checkout -b my-fix-branch master
   ```

1. Create your patch, **including appropriate test cases**.
1. Follow our [Coding Rules](#rules).
1. Run the full yesterday test suite
1. Commit your changes using a descriptive commit message that follows our
   [commit message conventions](#commit). Adherence to these conventions
   is necessary because release notes are automatically generated from these messages.

   ```shell
   git commit -a
   ```

   Note: the optional commit `-a` command line option will automatically "add" edited files.

1. Push your branch to GitHub:

   ```shell
   git push origin my-fix-branch
   ```

1. In GitHub, send a pull request to `yesterday-client:master`.

* If we suggest changes then:

  * Make the required updates.
  * Re-run the yesterday test suites to ensure tests are still passing.
  * Rebase your branch and force push to your GitHub repository (this will update your Pull Request):

    ```shell
    git rebase master -i
    git push -f
    ```

That's it! Thank you for your contribution!

#### Keeping pull request updated

```shell
  git checkout master
  git pull upstream master
  git checkout your-feature-branch
  git rebase upstream/master
  
  Once you have fixed the conflicts
  
  git rebase --continue
  git push -f
```

#### After your pull request is merged

After your pull request is merged, you can safely delete your branch and pull the changes
from the main (upstream) repository:

* Delete the remote branch on GitHub either through the GitHub web UI or your local shell as follows:

  ```shell
  git push origin --delete my-fix-branch
  ```

* Check out the master branch:

  ```shell
  git checkout master -f
  ```

* Delete the local branch:

  ```shell
  git branch -D my-fix-branch
  ```

* Update your master with the latest upstream version:

  ```shell
  git pull --ff upstream master
  ```

## <a name="development"></a> Development Setup

You will need Node.js version 8.9.0+.

1. After cloning the repo, run:

```bash
$ npm i # (or yarn install)
```

2. In order to prepare your environment run `prepare.sh` shell script:

```bash
$ sh scripts/prepare.sh // IN PROGRESS
```

### Commonly used NPM scripts

```bash
# build all packages and put them near to their source files
$ npm run build

# run the full unit tests suite
$ npm run test

# run integration tests
# docker is required(!)
$ sh scripts/run-integration.sh // IN PROGRESS

# run linter
$ npm run lint
```

## <a name="rules"></a> Coding Rules

To ensure consistency throughout the source code, keep these rules in mind as you are working:

* All features or bug fixes **must be tested** by one or more specs (unit-tests).
* We follow [Google's JavaScript Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/jsguide.html).

## <a name="commit"></a> Commit Message Guidelines

We have very precise rules over how our git commit messages can be formatted. This leads to **more
readable messages** that are easy to follow when looking through the **project history**.

### Commit Message Format

Each commit message consists of a **header**, a **body** and a **footer**. The header has a special
format that includes a **type**, a **scope** and a **subject**:

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>
<BLANK LINE>
<body>
<BLANK LINE>
<footer>
```

The **header** is mandatory and the **scope** of the header is optional.

Any line of the commit message cannot be longer 100 characters! This allows the message to be easier
to read on GitHub as well as in various git tools.

Footer should contain a [closing reference to an issue](https://help.github.com/articles/closing-issues-via-commit-messages/) if any.

Samples: (even more [samples](https://github.com/igroup-opole/yesterday-client/commits/master))

```
docs(contributing) update list of commit types
bugfix(core) need to depend on latest rxjs
```

### Type

Must be one of the following:

* **build**: Changes that affect the build system or external dependencies
* **ci**: Changes to our CI configuration files and scripts
* **docs**: Documentation only changes
* **feature**: A new feature
* **bugfix**: A bug fix
* **performance**: A code change that improves performance
* **refactor**: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
* **style**: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons, etc)
* **test**: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests

### Subject

The subject contains succinct description of the change:

* use the imperative, present tense: "change" not "changed" nor "changes"
* don't capitalize first letter
* no dot (.) at the end

### Body

Just as in the **subject**, use the imperative, present tense: "change" not "changed" nor "changes".
The body should include the motivation for the change and contrast this with previous behavior.

### Footer

The footer should contain any information about **Breaking Changes** and is also the place to
reference GitHub issues that this commit **Closes**.
